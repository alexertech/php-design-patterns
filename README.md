# php-design-patterns

This is a very (very) old project to develop a CRUD with a code generator implemeting Design Patterns. 

Please note that this was developed for PHP 5.1 / 5.2, when PHP was starting to be a full POO. Was used in production during 2008-2010 with very nice performance results, so nothing to complain. 

Back in 2008, I developed this framework that let me generate appliactions from a database using the "parts/generador/generar.sh" script. This is very outdated and probably have security issues, but you can review the "lib" folder where is the original Factory.php, Data Access Objects and  Model. Views were handled in the root of the site and control handles all the controllator objects.

Its very well documented (I think), but in spanish. 

Will update this project on a different repo to use modern patterns, but feel free to fork, comment, review.
